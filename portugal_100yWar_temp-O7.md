===== Debate Round-1 =====

----- Affirmative side -----
**A: Yes, Portugal was heavily involved in the Hundred Years War.**

The Hundred Years War was a series of conflicts between England and France from 1337 to 1453. Portugal was a powerful maritime power during this period, and its ships played a significant role in the war effort.

* Portugal captured the island of Rhodes in 1396, which was a major source of revenue for the English.
* Portugal sent warships to join the French army in 1386 and played a vital role in the French victory at the Battle of Crécy.
* Portugal was also a major supplier of weapons and supplies to the French, including gunpowder and armor.

**B: No, Portugal was not involved in the Hundred Years War.**

There is no evidence to support the claim that Portugal was involved in the Hundred Years War.

----- Negative side -----
**Answer:**

While Portugal did have a significant presence in the Mediterranean Sea during the Hundred Years War, their involvement in the conflict itself is questionable.

* **Limited direct involvement:** Portugal's direct involvement in the war was relatively limited compared to other major players like England and France. They primarily provided naval support and occasional military aid to both sides.
* **Lack of decisive contribution:** While Portugal captured Rhodes and played a role in the French victory at Crécy, their contribution was not as significant as some other factors like the Battle of Hastings.
* **Ambiguous relationship with England:** While Portugal maintained good relations with England, there is no evidence to suggest that they were actively involved in the war effort.

**Reasons:**

* **Absence of concrete evidence:** There is no substantial historical record or confirmed accounts to support the claim that Portugal played a major role in the Hundred Years War.
* **Focus on broader maritime influence:** Portugal's involvement primarily focused on providing naval support and resources rather than engaging directly in the conflict itself.
* **Influence of other powers:** Other major powers like England and France were more heavily involved in the war, highlighting Portugal's relatively limited contribution.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available evidence, while Portugal's maritime power and involvement in the Mediterranean Sea were significant, their involvement in the Hundred Years War itself is questionable. Other major players like England and France played a more significant role in the conflict.
